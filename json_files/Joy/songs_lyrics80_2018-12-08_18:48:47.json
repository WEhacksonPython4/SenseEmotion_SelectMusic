  "lyrics": "遠く感じたのは今日に限ったことじゃない無理に笑えない不器用さをはがゆく思ってる そう今を変える言葉が見つからない とりあえず黙ってうつむいたままで考えたふりをしよう月日が経つにつれて不安が舞い降りてくる幸せを問いかける回数がお互い増えてくる形を欲しがるのは疑いを持ってるの なんとなくうやむやにするのが嫌なだけなんだろう会いたい気持ちとずっと付き合って歩こう言葉を越えたい想いをずっと確かめていこう二人が子供でケンカして笑って泣いて初めて生まれる時間を拾い集めていこうChristmas Rose 不安にさせないで一人にしないでChristmas Rose 約束を果たそう陽の当たる坂道を登る決心を掲げ忘れたものも一緒に二人で運んでいこう日々が過ぎ秋になり冬の雪の夜だってこれからを誓えるように優しくなれるように会いたい気持ちとずっと付き合って歩こう言葉を越えたい想いをずっと確かめていこうー",
  "translated_lyrics": "It's not the only thing that I felt so far from it today. I can't find words that I can't make, and I can't find a word that I'm going to change now, and I'm sure that the number of things that I'm going to want to do is to pretend to be more and more uneasy, and then to ask for the shape that they're going to ask for the happiness of the uneasiness. I want to see how I don't like it, I always want to see it. I always love to see you, and I'm going to be a kid, and I'm going to pick up the first time I'm going to be born with a kid, and I'm going to pick up my first time when I'm laughing and crying, and I don't want you to worry about Christmas Rose, don't do it alone, Rose, I would like to make my promises, and I'd like to climb the slope of the sun, and I forget that I'm going to be able to meet my days in the autumn, and I want to be kind of like this. I want to be kind of like this. I want to be kind of like this. I want to be kind of like this. I want to go beyond words.",
