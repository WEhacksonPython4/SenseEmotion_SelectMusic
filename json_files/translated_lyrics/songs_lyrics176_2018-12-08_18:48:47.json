  "lyrics": "流れる時沈まぬ様に生きる沢山の星が何処かに消えていく何より強い光ならば...いつか気付くのかも知れないつま先眺め渡る道の先影の中で拾った言葉は嘘俯かなければ聴こえるメロディ.....肩にそっと降りて街が輝くと不意に立ち止まって見上げるSeason shift away the wind.あの日を思い出す時Season shift away the world.雪が降り始めるSeason shift away the sky.雪が積もる頃にはSeason shift away my mind.あの日を歩いている凍えていた大切な失えない必要な面影に息吹きかけて過ぎ去りし夢.....遠い記憶を抱え家路辿りながら体震わせて首を竦めた独り言――Season shift away the wind.あの日の喜びをSeason shift away the world.今日に照らし合わせてSeason shift away the sky.今夜一人この部屋でSeason shift away my mind.いつかの答えを探す窓の外.....白い夜床の上へ雪のように白い爪が零れ落ちるCaroi is your voice for me all my loveStar is your eyes for me all my sweetBut it may not be that important for me",
  "translated_lyrics": "If a lot of stars are going to disappear into the water when they flow through, it's a strong light, and if you're so strong,One day, maybe you'll notice that the words that you picked up in the shadows of the vanguarable street are the melodies that you listen to if you don't feel a liar.The Season shift away from the shoulders and the shining streets quietly looked up to the wind and the wind was wind.When you remember that day, Season shift away the world.The snow begins to come down, Season shift away the sky.By the time the snow was going on, Season shift away, my mind.I was walking on that day. I was freezing. I blew over the shadow of the last thing I needed to lose, and I dreamt that I was just gone.One of my long memories, trembling and shaking my neck with a long way of remembering my neck -- Season shift away the wind.The joy of that day, Season shift away the world.Season shift away today, shift away the sky.Tonight, in this room, Season shift away, my mind.I'll find the answers to some day out of the window.Caroi is your voice for me, all sweet-white nails on the floor, like snow on the floor, like snow on the floor, and the snow-white nails."
