  "lyrics": "Destiny　やっと巡り会えたね　胸の奥の気持ち隠したままday by day　会う度に募る　言葉の欠片が心に積もる木枯らしのせいにして　oh Darlin'ぎゅっと抱きしめて　二度と離さないで　Stay with meたとえどんなことがあっても　旅の途中ではぐれてしまってもあなたを信じる　未来を選んだ　I don't want to regret　後悔しないあなたを愛する　命の果てには　奇跡が舞い降りるSuddenly　人生なんてさ　虚しいばかりだと　空を仰ぐLet me light you up forever　世界が闇に包まれようと一筋のきらめきで照らす幾千の星屑は　oh Darlin'あなたの涙の数だと知ってる　I Love you夢がどんなに果てなくても　迷っても　挫けても　泣き崩れてもあなたと生きると　私は誓った　I don't want to regret　後悔しないあなたを愛する　命の果てには　奇跡が舞い降りる冷たい指で髪を撫でる　温かい唇が重なる時間よ　永遠に止まれたとえどんなことがあっても　旅の途中ではぐれてしまってもあなたを信じる　未来を選んだ　I don't want to regret　後悔しないあなたを愛する　命の果てには　奇跡が舞い降りるもうすぐ　クリスマスがやってくる",
