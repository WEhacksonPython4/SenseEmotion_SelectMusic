  "lyrics": "天使達も家路につくよ　クリスマスの夜は兵士達も手を休めて　互い向い会う微笑みがもどるI wish it could be Christmas everydayきらめく街の灯とI wish it could be Christmas everyday苦い想い出や　悲しいことやままならない時も月の光に打ち明ければとずっと信じてきた　ほらきっと届くはず去年は　話し声や歌も踊る今年は　二人だけの悲しいDinner罪のない者たちが　望みにかかわらずそれぞれの場所　それぞれの道決められて進むI wish it could be Christmas everydayみんな星にかえるI wish it could be Christmas everyday悲しみよさようならI wish it could be Christmas everydayきらめく　Innocent Eyes胸が踊るよ　プレゼント時間(トキ)　めぐり廻ってもPaPa & Mam'は皆それぞれひとりしかいない　家路へと帰る眠りの国　『おやすみなさい』",

I wish it would be. I wish it would be my wish. I wish it would be sad. I wish it would be sadness. Eyes, the chest is dancing. The time of the gift, the PPa & Mam, is the home of the PaPa and Mam. \"Good night,\"",
