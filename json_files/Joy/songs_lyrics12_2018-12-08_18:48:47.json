  "lyrics": "12月は人がせわしなく　とても嫌いネオンライトが　網膜にはりついて吐息が聞こえるぐらいに　そばに寄ってみて　ここにいてX'masには欲しがってたリングを買ってあなたが生まれてくれた事感謝する「幸せになる」が口癖になるほど酔った日は　逢えなくて僕達なりの愛の表現は　暗い海洋にさまよう船月影のよう今年も雪の無い年の瀬　手を繋いだら夜が明けるね去年と同じ気持ちでいる　瞳を閉じたら消えそうなあなたは「それゆえに愛が深まる」と抱き合いながら　うわの空愛という形の無いものは　とても嫌い片方の心が冷めれば終わるから身体を重ねて感じ合えるものの深さに脅えてる加速する世迷の大人の群れ　見せかけの悪の正論者達黄昏に死す明日を計る術などなく　永遠を誰も見たくないあなたの声が耳に響く　それだけで胸が熱くなる今年も雪の無い年の瀬　手を繋いだら夜が明けるね去年と同じ気持ちでいる　瞳を閉じたら消えそうなあなたは「それゆえに愛が深まる」と抱き合いながら　うわの空",
  "translated_lyrics": "In December, when people don't want to hear about it, it's like a neonlight that hates on the retina, and I'm here to buy a ring that I want you to come down to, and I want to thank you for what you're saying for me, and I'll thank you for the fact that you're lucky enough to be so drunk that you've got a little bit of a drunken ocean, you can see the moon in the dark ocean,　When you close your eyes, you feel like, \"That's why love is deepening.\" It's like, it's like, it's like, \"It's too bad for you to feel love.\" And it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, you know, it's going to be like this, you know, you can't look at it, you know, you know, you can't look at it again. You hear your voice. You hear your voice. You hear your voice, you know, you know, you're going to have a big deal. You can hear your voice in your ears. You'll see your voice in your ears.　If you close your eyes, you're gonna disappear, so you'll love to love it, and you'll be loved, so you're gonna be loved.",
