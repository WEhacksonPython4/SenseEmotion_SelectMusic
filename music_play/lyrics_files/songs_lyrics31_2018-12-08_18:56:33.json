    "lyrics": "All alone I watch the quiet rainWonder if it's gonna snow againSilent night, Holy nightI was prayingyou'd be here with meBut Christmas Eve ain'twhat it used to beSilent night, Holy nightIf you were beside meThen I could hear angelsAnd I'd give you rainbows,for ChristmasSomewhere far awaythe sleighbells ringI rememberwhen we used to singSilent night, Holy nightI keep you inside meOh the truth is unspoken,So my heart won't be broken,on ChristmasThey lit the treesalong the avenueTwinkling silver with a touch of blueSilent night, Holy night"
