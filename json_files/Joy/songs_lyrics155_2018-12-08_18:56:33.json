  "lyrics": "So many life times So many placesI don't know nothing What time it wasBut I feel that I had been with youA Christmas like thisNow Baby 粉雪が静かに 夜を連れて来るわ遠くで響く carolAnd Baby 窓に指で星とモミの木の絵を描いて待つのよ貴方の足音 なぜかみつめ合うそのたびトナカイの鈴の音聞いてたわ いつもいつも愛を今夜貴方に Christmas gift for youどこか聖らかな銀世界空を飛ぶソリに乗ってセイクレッド・ソング 聞こえる国へ愛を今夜貴方 Christmas gift for youHow many more times How many tearsBut I don't care How we will beOnly I know that will love againA Christmas like this",
