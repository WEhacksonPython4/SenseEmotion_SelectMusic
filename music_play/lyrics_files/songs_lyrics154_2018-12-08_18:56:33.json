    "lyrics": "Last ChristmasI gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis yearTo save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialLast ChristmasI gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis yearTo save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialOnce bitten and twice shyI keep my distanceBut you still catch my eyeTell me babyDo you recognize me？WellIt's been a yearIt doesn't surprise me(Happy Christmas)I wrapped it up and sent itWith a note saying “I love you”I meant itNow I know what a fool I've beenBut if you kissed me nowI know you'd fool me againLast ChristmasI gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis yearTo save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialA crowded roomFriends with tired eyesI'm hiding from youAnd your soul of iceMy godI thought you were someone to rely onMe?I guess I was a shoulder to cry onA face on a lover with a fire in his heartA man under cover but you tore me apartNow I've found a real loveYou'll never fool me againLast ChristmasI gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis yearTo save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special"
