I just want to see you. I just want to see your face. I just want to see you. I just want to see you. I just want to see you. I just want to see you,　I just want to see you. I just want to see you. I want to see you in a moment. I want to see you. I want to see you. I just want to see you. I just want to see you. I just want to see you. I just want to see you. Christmas is like this.",
