  "translated_lyrics": "It's a flash, it's a little bit of a little girl, it's just a little, it's Christmas Day, and it's on the road that you're walking around, and you're standing alone in the way you're walking around. You and your favorite candle that you've been walking around, you and your favorite candle that you love, you love it, and the sky is still in the distance, it's Christmas Time, and you're going to see it. It's Christmas Time　♫ If you're not going to come back ♫ ♫ Believe it's Christmas Night, ♫ ♫ Thank you, ♫ ♫ Thank you, ♫ ♫ And I want to say thank you ♫ ♫ I love the candles I love ♫ ♫ I love you, ♫ ♫ I love you, ♫ ♫ I love you, ♫ ♫ I love you and I love you ♫ ♫ And I's Christmas Timeit's lonely, lonely nightit's special dayit's Christmas, ♫ ♫ Time, I'd like to lean on my favorite candle till the flame is erased, and you and the two of you love the moon, and the sky is still so far away, it's Christmas Time."
