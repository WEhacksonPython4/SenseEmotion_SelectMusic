I don't want to turn around tonight. I don't want to turn around tonight, Star Light, Night, or Star Light. I don't want anything else. I don't want anything else except you. You know, you don't look like you.　I want you to forget all about it. Merry Christmas with You Hoshes. Bench for you. Night-Night, Star Light, I want to get lost. Holy Night, Star Light, I want to trust you, and touch the hot side of the way, all the time, and trust me?I don't want to stare at it. Merry Christmas with you. I don't want to turn it around again. I don't want to turn it around. I don't want nothing more than that. Merry Christmas with You. Merry Christmas with You. Wow, Night, Night, I'll never turn around again tomorrow. Star Light Night, if you're the only one, you're the only one. Night, I don't want anything else.",
