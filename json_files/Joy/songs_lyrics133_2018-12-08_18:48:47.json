  "lyrics": "もうこれで終わりね　指輪のあとが白いこんな日に限って雪は降り続くのね二人で暮らした二年が短くて貴方に何一つ出来なかったけど今日までのすべては誰も奪うことはないサヨナラのChristmas　街中に灯がともる一人でも寒くはないわサヨナラのChristmas　去年より灯がともる貴方は別のぬくもり抱いて夜を越す強がりに頼って「らしく」見せてるけれど哀しみをこらえる小説はありますか元気に暮らして欲しいと言われても素直に返事さえ出来なくてツライもうこれで終わりね　指輪のあとが白いサヨナラのChristmas　テーブルの灯が消えて今日からは名前も変わるサヨナラのChristmas　大人だと言ってても微笑むときの貴方の顔は未だ若いサヨナラのChristmas　街中に灯がともる一人でも寒くはないわサヨナラのChristmas　去年より灯がともる貴方は別のぬくもり抱いて夜を越す",
  "translated_lyrics": "It's over. It's about the end of the ring. It snows only on a white day, and it's snowing for a second. I couldn't do anything for you. I don't want to take any of you. It's a Christmas town in a Sayonara. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's a Christmas in the city of Sayonara.　You know, I've got a little more light than last year, and I'm like, \"I'm like,\" I'm going to have to go on the night, and I'm showing you a pity, but I don't want to be honest with you, but I don't have to be honest, and I'm going to end with the end of this. I'm going to end with a Christmas table, and I'm going to change my name, and I'm going to change my name, and I'm just going to change my name today. I'm still a young man of Saayonara.　There's no cold in the city, but it's not cold, Sayonara's Christmas lit up last year, and you'll have another mighter in the night with your lights.",
