  "lyrics": "木漏れ陽に　照らされた　本当のキミの顔腕の中で　子供みたい　夢見て早起きが　きいたみたい　午前5時　はしゃぎすぎて待ちこがれた　クリスマスを居眠りして　終わらせてしまうのかい海へ行こう　波が来るよ天気予報は　今夜はもしかしたら雪OFFの日は　海ばかり　私はつきそいね口唇を　とがらせて　それでも　笑って人嫌いの　僕だけど　手をつないで　OH　街へ出よう恋人達が　見つめ合ったりキスをしたり　クリスマス彩れば僕の腕を　強く引いて僕の頬に　小さくキスをしたねプレゼントも　買い終わったし海へ行こう　今夜は　もしかしたら雪",
  "translated_lyrics": "It's like a kid in the middle of the leaky. It's like a kid, it's like a child. It's like a baby, it's going to fall asleep. It's going to fall asleep. It's going to fall asleep. It's going to end up. It's going to fall asleep. It's going to fall asleep. It's going to be the ocean. It's going to be snowy. It's going to be a little bit like that. It's a beautiful day. It's a beautiful day. I'm just smiling. I'm laughing, but I hate it, but I don't like it, and I'm going to the OH Street, and my lovers look at me, and they kiss me,　And if you have a Christmas, you pull my arm tightly on my cheek, you kiss my cheek, you kiss the little kisses, and I'm going to the sea tonight, and I'll go to the beach.",
