  "translated_lyrics": "A little bit of your hand Santa Claus gave me a little handful of Santa Claus, and it was a little bit of you and a little bit of a little bit of the candle, and it was a little bit of a little, you know, a little bit of a little bit of your hand. Santa Claus, who was a little bit of a little bit of Santa Claus, who was a little bit warm, and I was here with you, and I was so happy to see you and I was so happy ♫ I'll give you a gift ♫ ♫ Merry Christmas, the street trees, trees ♫ ♫ And the white muddy ♫ ♫ of the little ♫ ♫ ♫ in my pocket ♫ ♫ the little you ♫ ♫ the little you ♫ ♫ La Santa Claus ♫ ♫ and now you and the Very Merry Christmas, ♫ ♫ Merry Christmas, ♫",
