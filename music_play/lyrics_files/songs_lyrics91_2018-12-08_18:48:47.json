    "lyrics": "There is a party once in every year.A party that everybody has long awaited.Today is the day when Jesus Christ was born.You know that's right.What's it gotta do with?There are few who believe in religion in our realmBut don't you think it makes us happy to thinkthat we celebrate somebody-else's birthday?On that day nobody complains.No one cares it we drink six packs and get drunk.CHEERS. OH, YEAH!Let's party, dance, and spend all night together.It is a waste of time to watch TV at home.(Let's rock)!on such a wonderful day, today!on such a peaceful day, today!It's a SUPER DRUNKEN CHRISTMAS party tonight!"
