    "lyrics": "Last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special.Last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special.Once bitten and twice shyI keep my distance but you still catch my eyeTell me baby, Do you recognize me?Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me(Happy Christmas!)I wrapped it up and sent itWith a note saying “I love you” I meant itNow I know what a fooll've beenBut if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me againLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special.Last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special.A crowded room, friends with tired eyesI'm hiding from you and your soul of iceMy god I thought you were someone to rely on?Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry onA face on a lover with a fire in his heartA man undercover but you tore me apartNow I found a real love you'll never fool me againLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special.Last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it away.This year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone special."
