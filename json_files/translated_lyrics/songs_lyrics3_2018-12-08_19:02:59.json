  "lyrics": "君が教えてくれた　一人じゃないそういってくれたね今さら少し遅いけど君がいなければ　今日は違ってた誰もがいつかそっと思い出にあかりをつけてめぐり合えた　不思議に気づく夜が来ると君は知っていた奇跡を望むなら今を投げ出さないで君自身が明日から今日の君を見てる夜明けを待ちながら聞こえる街のうたはあの頃のまま　white Christmas届けたい　もう一度merry X'mas to you気がつくよりも早く　変わっていく人は日々流されて気持ちは時をこえるけど振り返るたびに悲しみもうすれ忘れてしまう事に心痛めたりしないでそれはつめたさじゃなく生きてゆけるための人が持つ強さ奇跡を望むなら涙におぼれないでしあわせにはふさわしい理由があるから夜明けを待ちながら降り積もる雪の中君の声が聞こえたそんな気になれるよ今夜は…ささやかなぬくもりが希望をつないでゆく見つめあう　勇気があるのなら奇跡を望むなら今を投げ出さないで君自身が明日から今日の君を見てる夜明けを待ちながら聞こえる街のうたはあの頃のまま　white Christmas届けたい　もう一度merry X'mas to you",
  "translated_lyrics": "You know, it's not the one that you taught me, but it's a little late, but if you're not there, you're not going to be able to come out today, and you're going to see a miracle, and you're looking at the miracle that you're looking at, and you're looking at you today, and you're looking at you today, and you're looking at your day, and you're looking at you today. You want to hear about it, you know, you know, you're looking at the white Christmas. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to be alive and sad, and you're not going to lose your heart, and you want to be alive and you want to be alive. You can't fall into tears. You can't fall into tears, and you're looking for a miracle, so you can hear your voice in the middle of the snow.　And if you're brave, if you want miracles, don't throw it right now, and you're waiting for the dawn of your day, and you're looking at your day, and you're looking at the dawn of the night, and you're looking at the white Christmas, and you're going to take it for a Christmas."
