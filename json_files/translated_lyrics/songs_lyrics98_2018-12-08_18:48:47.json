  "lyrics": "Tonight　空に揺れる星屑に線を足してTonight　ふたりだけの新しい星座を描こう言葉がなくても伝わるから君が眠るまでそばにいるよふたりきりの　Merry Christmas瞳をそらさないで君と過ごす　Merry Christmas優しく抱きしめてあげるふたりきりの　Merry Christmasその手を離さないで君と過ごす　Merry Christmas優しく抱きしめてあげる",
  "translated_lyrics": "There's a Merry Christmas that you spend all over the way you're asleep because you don't have to draw a new constellation in the sky, and you don't have to touch it. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, you and I will spend your time with you. Merry Christmas, you're going to spend your time with you. You'll have a nice, Christmas,"
