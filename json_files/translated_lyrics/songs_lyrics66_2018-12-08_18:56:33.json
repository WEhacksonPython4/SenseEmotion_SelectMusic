  "lyrics": "うるうると風も濡れる五月雨に鳴く声はただ静かに木霊する徒然に過ぎ去る日を懐かしみ君の名を愛しき名を口にする永遠に囚われるふりをしてキスをしたまるで夜露をまとったような君の髪に触れながら夢を見た君の胸で眠る夢甘やかな香り　君が放つ頃雨音がただ静かに窓を打ち悲しみが頬をつたい流れ落つ目が覚めるゆるゆると朽ち果てゆく森のようにこの身さえ風となり塵となりぬ徒然に過ぎ去る日よさようなら君の名を愛しき名を胸に抱く",
  "translated_lyrics": "In May, when the wind is wet, the sound of the rain is just shining quietly, and when I leave the days away, I kiss your name and kiss your hair forever, touching your hair, touching your hair, and dreamy of your hair, and you have a sweet fragrance to your hair.　You know, when you're released, the rainy season is just quietly beating the window, and the grief wakes up in the face, and the wind is falling into the wind, and the wind is passing through the wind, and it's too much in vain. So, if you look at your name, your name is still in your chest."
