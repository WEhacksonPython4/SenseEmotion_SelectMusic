  "lyrics": "煌めくJingle Bell　特別な季節そっとChristmas Candleが揺れるその向こう君に会いに行きたい伝えきれない気持ち笑顔でごまかしてた教室ですれ違う　何か、探して心で読み解いてはわかったつもりでいた言い出せない想いを　抱えたまま聖なる夜は　なぜか眠れなくて願い星へと想いを綴る明日は素直になって…Merry Christmas　特別なパーティーを君と過ごしたいサンタクロースじゃなくても　願いを叶えて本物が欲しいなら　ちゃんと見つけに一緒に行こうプレゼントはどうする？考えてる時間も　宝物になってゆくよ大切に想うほど臆病になる気持ちそれでもただ　優しさを君はくれたね放課後　いつもの場所交差する言葉たち偽りなら　脱ぎ捨てて　近づきたい街路樹に咲く　キレイなイルミネーション思い出達を　包み込むように先へと煌めいてるMerry Christmas　君といるこの景色が嬉しくっていつもよりはしゃいでる私がいるんだよわからないから知りたい　それぞれに繰り返して想いの交差点で　心繋ぎ合えたらまた前に進める　きっとMerry Christmas　特別なパーティーを君と過ごしたいいつもよりはしゃいでる私に気づいて本物が欲しいなら　ちゃんと見つけに一緒に行こうプレゼントありがとう私からも贈りたい　不器用でも受け止めてねMerry Christmas to you",
