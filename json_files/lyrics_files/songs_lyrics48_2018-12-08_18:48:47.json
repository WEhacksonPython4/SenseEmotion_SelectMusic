    "lyrics": "Silent night, holy nightAll is calm, all is brightRound you virgin Mother and ChildHoly infant so tender and mindSleep in heavenly peaceSleep in heavenly peaceI'm dreaming of a White Christmas Just like the onesI used to know Where the treetops glistenAnd Children listen to hearSleigh bells in the snowI'm dreaming of a White Christmas With everyChristmas card I write“May your days be merry and brightAnd may all your Christmases be white”"
