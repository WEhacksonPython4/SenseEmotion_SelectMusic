    "lyrics": "Chestnuts roasting on an open fireJack Frost nipping at your noseYuletide carols being sung by a choirAnd folks dressed up like EskimosEverybody knows a turkey and some mistletoeHelp to make the season brightTiny tots with their eyes all aglowWill find it hard to sleep tonightThey know that Santa's on his wayHe's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleighAnd every mother's child is gonna spyTo see if reindeer really know how to flyAnd so I'm offering this simple phraseTo kids from one through ninety-twoAlthough it's been said many times many waysMerry Christmas to youAnd so I'm offering this simple phraseTo kids from one through ninety-twoAlthough it's been said many times many waysMerry Christmas to you"
