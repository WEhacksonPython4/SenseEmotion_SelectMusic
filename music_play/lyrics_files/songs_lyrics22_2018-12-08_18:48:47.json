    "lyrics": "I don't want a lot for ChristmasThere is just one thing I needI don't care about presentsUnderneath the Christmas treeI just want you for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come true ohAll I want for Christmas is youI don't want a lot for ChristmasThere is just one thing I need, and IDon't care about presentsUnderneath the Christmas treeI don't need to hang my stockingThere upon the fireplaceSanta Claus won't make me happyWith a toy on Christmas dayI just want you for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come trueAll I want for Christmas is youI won't ask for much this ChristmasI won't even wish for snow, and II just wanna keep on waitingUnderneath the mistletoeI won't make a list and send itTo the North Pole for Saint NickI won't even stay awakeTo hear those magic reindeer click'Cause I just want you here tonightHolding on to me so tightWhat more can I doOh, Baby all I want for Christmas is youAll the lights are shiningSo brightly everywhereAnd the sound of children'sLaughter fills the airAnd everyone is singingI hear those sleigh bells ringingSanta won't you bring meThe one I really needWon't you please bring my baby to me quicklyI don't want a lot for ChristmasThis is all I'm asking forI just want to see my babyStanding right outside my doorI just want him for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come trueBaby all I want for Christmas is youAll I want for Christmas is you, baby"
