  "lyrics": "クリスマスまで待たせないでいたずらに時が過ぎてゆくなんでもない日も側にいたいのI'm already ah loving you長い冬は何を想う春になればみんな旅の支度私たちの季節はもうすぐクリスマスまで待たせないで街中が君に恋してるかっこつけないでよ私の前ではI'm already ah loving you白い雪が山を包む渡り鳥がしばし羽を閉じる二人きりのクリスマスイヴ会う度に距離は縮むようで少しずつ心すれ違う約束事よりも今の気持ちを聞きたくてクリスマスまで待たせないで人はなぜ明日を追いかける？大切な人を大切にするそれだけでいいんですI'm already ah loving you",
  "translated_lyrics": "♫ Don't wait until Christmas ♫ ♫ I'm going to be too busy ♫ ♫ Don't let me die ♫ ♫ Everybody in the spring ♫ ♫ Don't let me wait until Christmas ♫ ♫ Don't let me wait until Christmas ♫ ♫ Don't let me wait ♫ ♫ Don't let me fall in town ♫ ♫ I'm not in love with you ♫ ♫ I'm just here, ♫ ♫ and I'm in the city ♫ You know, why don't you keep your white snow in the mountains of the mountains, you close your wings, and you keep your distance away from the promise that you're on your way to Christmas Eve? Why don't you wait until Christmas and wait until Christmas to hear your feelings?I'm just going to take care of the people that are important. I'm I.am. I'm already, loving you."
