  "translated_lyrics": "The stars in the velved' s sky will soon change into snow. In the city, the lovers swore a special oath of eternal love at the restaurant where they found the eternal love that they found in two people.\"I wonder where you will recall\" It's hard to say \" Merry Christmas!I'm not going home tonight. I'm alone tonight. I don't like you anymore, because I don't like you. I want to take care of the loneliness of my tail. I can't drink that night's wine. I want to say to say I want to be. Merry Christmas!Whose snow is going to be, I want to say! Merry Christmas!Hart It's hard to say, \" Merry Christmas!\"I wonder where you will recall\" It's hard to say \" Merry Christmas!Time I Do Not Go"
