Holy shit! Hot Christmas, your favorite girl, her boyfriend, Ski, Souclay! Holy shit! Hot Christmas, you're alone, and I'm the sun and the sand tree, and it's the avanture of the Decoration Hawaiians, and I can tell you, if you're still there, you can't open up, you can't open the parasol, you can't open it, you can't even see, you suddenly remind me. Holy shit! Hot Christmas Island is not lonely with your lovers! You're gonna be willing! Holy shit! The Hot Christmas Northern Hemisphere snow spurts you to spur you, SituationFelice Navida!It's okay, Holy! Holy shit! Hot Christmas, this is what you're trying to start today, the wave of the snow, my Holy! Holy shit! Hot Christmas doesn't have to talk to you for the first time, and then I decided that it would be a good day, and I wouldn't call it, but I love it. I love you."
