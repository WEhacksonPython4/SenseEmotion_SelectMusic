    "lyrics": "From the snow outside it is a little lightEmbraced by fresh air and holy silenceInside the dressed up housesSouls gathering gently close togetherEven fathers and mothers who are always fightingHold hands and make upGive your cute kids your endless loveFor the two of you, and for your childrenYou'll probably swear to protect your precious familyTonite it's christmasHappy feelings in the airTonite it's christmasHate will prabably fade awayFrom the pressure of being busyEven your tired soutWill recollect the warmth of people"
