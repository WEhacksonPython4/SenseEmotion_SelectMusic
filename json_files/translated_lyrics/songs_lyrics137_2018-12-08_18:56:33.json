  "lyrics": "君去りしクリスマス　空っぽのこの部屋片付けが済んでないのは心の中残された　小さなツリー無くなったのは　君の荷物それだけじゃない　分かっているはず何も考えられないまま　外へと誰か僕を導いてくれきらきらと街は踊り出すきんこんと鐘が響いてすれ違う恋人も　ほら楽しそうだねふわふわと街を歩くんだゆらゆら冷たい風に何だか今　世界で一人ぼっちそんな気がしてきたんだ君がいたクリスマス　去年のクリスマス聖なる日　あの日を忘れはしないさ幸せな時間(とき)抱きしめ　そのまま続くと思ってた君がくれた時計が止まった僕達の過ごした日々を君は思い出にきっと変えてしまうんだろうきらきらと光が放たれしゃんしゃんと愛のメロディ今君への思いが溢れてしまいそうふわふわと雪が落ちてくるゆらゆら彷徨う心今年のクリスマスはスキじゃない君の街も降ってるの?Last Christmas, Tears this ChristmasI'm gonna have a happy happy ChristmasLast Christmas, White ChristmasLove you, then now and foreverきらきらと街は踊り出すきんこんと鐘が響いてすれ違う恋人も　ほら楽しそうだねふわふわと街を歩くんだゆらゆら冷たい風に何だか今　世界で一人ぼっちそんな気がしてきたんだ",

It's like the sparkling and the sparkling, the mérody of love, you're going to fall into your heart, and you're not skiing around Christmas.Last Christmas, Tears this ChristmasmasI'm a happy happy Christmas.Last Christmas, White ChristmasonLove you, then now, then, then, and then the city will dance with a little bit of a bell resonated with a little bit of a bell.　I'm alone in the world. I feel like that kind of thing."
