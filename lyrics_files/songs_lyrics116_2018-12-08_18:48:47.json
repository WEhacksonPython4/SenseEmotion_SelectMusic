    "lyrics": "「I SAW MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS」I saw Mommy kissing Santa ClausUnderneath the mistletoe last nightShe didn't see me creepDown the stairs to have a peepShe thought that I was tucked upIn my bedroom fast asleepThen I saw Mommy tickle Santa ClausUnderneath his beard so snowy whiteOh, what a laugh it would have beenIf Daddy had only seenMommy kissing Santa Claus last nightlast night「LET IT SNOW！LET IT SNOW！LET IT SNOW！」Oh the weather outside is frightfulBut the fire is so delightfulAnd since we've no place to goLet it snow, Let it snow, Let it snowIt doesn't show signs of stoppingAnd I've brought some corn for poppingThe lights are turned way down lowLet it snow, Let it snow, Let it snowHow I hate going out in the stormBut if you really hold me tightAll the way home I'll be warmThe fire is slowly dyingAnd my dear, we're still goodbye-ingAs long as you love me soLet it snow, Let it snow, Let it snowLet it snow「WHITE CHRISTMAS」I'm dreaming of a White ChristmasJust like the ones I used to knowWhere the treetops glistenAnd children listenTo hear sleigh bells in the snowI'm dreaming of a White ChristmasWith every Christmas card I writeMay your days be merryAnd brightAnd may all your Christmases be whiteAnd may all your Christmases be white"
