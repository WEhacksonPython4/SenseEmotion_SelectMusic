  "translated_lyrics": "Have yourself a merry little Christmas, Let your heart be light, From now on, our troubles will be out of sight. Have yourself yourself a merry little Christmas, Make the Yuletide gay, From now on, our troubles. Far be far away. Here we are as in, Happy Known gone by, Faithful friends who are friends or dear friends who are to us all have have been together, If the Faints allowHang a shining star upon the highest boughAnd have yourself a merry little Christmas now."
