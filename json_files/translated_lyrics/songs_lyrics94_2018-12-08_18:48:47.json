I guess I was a shoulder to cry onA face on a lover with a fire in his heartA man undercover but you tore me apartNow I've found a real loveYou'll never fool me againLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day you gave it awayThis year to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialA face on a lover with a fire in his heartA man undercover but you tore him apartMaybe next year I'll give it to someoneI'll give it to someone special",
