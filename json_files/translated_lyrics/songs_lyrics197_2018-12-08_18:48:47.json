  "singer": "鈴木さえ子",
  "lyrics": "輪になって眠れば　おんなじ夢みれるかな夜のカーテン閉じて　窓をそっとあけよう瞳をそっと　とじようI wish it could be Christmas everydayゆらめく　ローソクとI wish it could be Christmas; everydayきらめく　リボン窓の外は　海にジャングル　砂漠に火星に街角ファムファタールにお願いすれば壁も歩ける空も飛ぶ去年は　怖かったな　夜を待つのが今年は　待ちどおしいな　日が暮れるのが輪になって眠れば　おんなじ夢みれるかな朝になってはかってみれば　背の高さもちがうかな同じ気持でいれるかなI wish it could be Christmas everydayゆらめく　ローソクとI wish it could be Christmas; everydayきらめく　リボンいつの間にか夜が消えて　朝もやかかるころ影を捜しに戻らなくちゃ　輪になって手をつなごう夜が明ける前に夜が明ける前に眠りの姫よ起きなさい",
  "translated_lyrics": "If you sleep in a circle, you'll be able to close the curtains of the night, I wish you to shut up the window, and you'll see the window soothed, you know, it's like Christmas, it's Christmas, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, you can go to the jungle desert in the jungle desert, and you can walk on　The night is waiting for the night, and if you sleep in a circle, if you sleep in a circle, you'll be able to sleep in a circle. I wish it would be a faint moron. I wish it Christmas, I wish it, I wish it Christmas, and my wish for Christmas, my wish it was Christmas; I wish it was Christmas; I wish it would be like Christmas, and I would like to see the night　In the morning, you have to go back to search for the shadows, and you have to come back and connect your hands, and you wake up before dawn, before you come to the night, and you wake up before you wake up."
