  "lyrics": "ずっと会えなくて電話もしなかったからねなんだか遠くの人みたいでさみしかったよわたしは何も変わってないけれどなんだかあなたがすっかり違くみえる夕方に日が暮れてもうすぐ寒い夜が来る天から星が降るような澄んだ夜空を喜びたいあなたと2人で温かい今日こそ2人で過ごしたいクリスマスの夜にそっと伝えたい寂しい時はいつでも歌っていたんだよいつかあなたが教えてくれた歌一人の時が多くて辛かったけど毎日の中で私はあなたを想ってた夢をつかんでもうすぐあたたかい夜が来るあなたが夢を叶えた日に一番最初に教えてほしい神様ずっと願っています愛する人を私のもとへクリスマスの夜にそっと伝えたい天から星が降るような澄んだ夜空を喜びたいあなたと2人で温かい今日こそ2人で過ごしたいクリスマスの夜にそっと伝えたいあなたにいつか　ちゃんと伝えたい",
  "translated_lyrics": "I didn' t have a phone call for a long time, because I hadn't had a phone call, I was like, \"I'm not going to change anything.\" I want to be a lonely night in the evening, and I want to be in a very difficult night, and I'd love to be a couple of people, and I would love to be there. I would love to be there. I would love to be there, and I would love to be there. I would love to be a song, and I would love to be a song. I was singing. I was singing. I was singing. I was a little bit more and I was a little bit hard, but I was so busy, and I was a little bit hard,I want you to tell me the first night when you dream about it, and I want you to be the first person to be able to tell me, and I want to tell you that I want to be the first person to tell you that I love you, and I want to tell you that there are two people who are warm and warm, and I want to tell you that I want to be here today. I want to tell you that I want to tell you that one day,"
