  "singer": "Chicago Poodle",
  "lyrics": "あの日あの場所でなぜ君に伝えられなかったのかいつまでも胸に Holy night 忘れられない大きなプレゼント抱えて　君が待つ部屋に急いだ小さなクリスマスツリーと　ぬくもりで幸せだった特別だなんて言わなくてもいいくらいの距離感　甘いルールあの日あの時君がくれた大切な宝物飾らないその笑顔はなによりも綺麗このまま離したくない気持ちと　言えそうにない秘めた夢(おもい)銀色に輝く　Holy night 雪が降り積もるLOOPして聴こえるのは　僕が選んだBGM甘い香りがするキャンドル　窓に映る揺れる灯ずっと二人でいられると思いたかったんだけど失う怖さ気づいてたはしゃぎ合って黙り込んで迫りくる何かを感じ抱き合ったあの日あの場所で君に伝えたかった言葉「叶えたい夢があるからそばに居て欲しい」今もし君がどこかでこの歌を聴いたなら変わらないこの京都(ふるさと)思い出して欲しい",
