  "lyrics": "去年のこの日、君と最後にブルーのクリスマスツリーの下で uh待ち合わせたあの場所で別れに 瞳濡らすなんてもう一度今夜なら会える気がするよあの日の雪が降りそうだよ空見つめて 泣いて言葉見つけて 書いて年に一度のSpecial Dayきっと届くこの愛で滲む夜空 白いため息忘れないあの夜の瞬をこごえそうな手をとり、そっと暖めてくれた 思い出すよ 今もこの胸に舞い降りた天使のような君にこの愛を空見つめて 泣いて言葉見つけて 書いて年に一度のSpecial Day遠く届くこの愛で奇跡さえも起こりそうな夜空を見上げるよ会いたい 思い出に願う答えは返らない笑うあなたの顔だけが浮かぶね、許したあの日々を 過去と呼んでしまうの?Happy and Merry Christmas to youはじまる奇跡が もうすぐ青いツリーの下で この夜きっと届く 君へ届く時の流れも 止めて願い叶えて 全て年に一度のSpecial Day遠く届くこの愛できっと届くこの愛で",
  "translated_lyrics": "I feel like I'll be able to meet you again tonight at the site of the last blue Christmas tree, and I'll be able to meet you again tonight. I'll look at it, and I'll find it, and I'll find it in my eyes, and I'll find it, and I'll find it, and I'm going to say, once a year, I'll be able to find a word, and I'm sure it's a Special Day, and I'm sure it's a Special Day, and I'm sure it's white, and I'm sure it's a night sky, and I'll just remember it. I remember it. I remember it. I was just warm. I was still blaming. I cry, find words, and write once a year, and I'll see the night sky, in this love that could even be a miracle in this love that could even be a miracle, and the answer I would like to see, which I would like to see, is that only your face would be floating, and you wouldn't call that the past to be forgiven?♫ Happy and Merry Christmas to you. ♫ ♫ And stop the miracle ♫ ♫ under the blue tree ♫ ♫ and stop the flow of reaching you ♫ ♫ All this year's Special Day away ♫ ♫ This is this love ♫ ♫ from this love ♫",
