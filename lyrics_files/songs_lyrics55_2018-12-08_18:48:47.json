    "lyrics": "I don't want a lot for ChristmasThere is just one thing I needI don't care about the presentsUnderneath the Christmas treeI just want you for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come trueAll I want for Christmas is youI don't want a lot for ChristmasThere is just one thing I needAnd I don't care about the presentsUnderneath the Christmas treeI don't need to hang my stockingThere upon the fireplaceSanta Claus won't make me happyWith a toy on Christmas dayI just want you for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come trueAll I want for Christmas is youYou babyI won't ask for much this ChristmasI won't even wish for snowI'm just gonna keep on waitingUnderneath the mistletoeI won't make a list and send itTo the North Pole for Saint NickI won't even stay awake toHear those magic reindeers click'Cause I just want you here tonightHolding on to me so tightWhat more can I do?Baby all I want for Christmas is youOoh babyAll the lights are shining so brightly everywhereAnd the sound of children's laughter fills the airAnd everyone is singingI hear those sleigh bells ringingSanta won't you bring me the one I really need won't youPlease bring my baby to meI don't want a lot for ChristmasThis is all I'm asking forI just want to see my babyStanding right outside my doorI just want you for my ownMore than you could ever knowMake my wish come trueBaby all I want for Christmas is You baby"
