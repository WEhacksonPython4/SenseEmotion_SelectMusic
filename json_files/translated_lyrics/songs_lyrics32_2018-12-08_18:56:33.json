  "translated_lyrics": "I just wanted to come back and meet him again, and I just wanted to hear it, so I just wanted to say, \"Once again, once again, once again, once again, once again, once again, how much time has passed?\"I don't want to notice when I'm so glad I'm so happy that I don't want to be able to get away. I don't want to leave my time. I don't want to leave my time. I don't want to leave my time. I just want to say it again. Kid, I just want to say, \"Once again, Oyasmi wants to hear it.\" Once again, once again, once again, once again, once again, once again, again-once, like the room again, and just like, like, what I was with, like, Like A, ♫ In my own vocal chord ♫ ♫ in the middle of the song ♫ ♫ in the vocal chord ♫ ♫ in my usual voice ♫ ♫ Say you miss me, too, ♫ ♫ I've got a little glass of snow, ♫ ♫ and there's snow on the other side ♫ ♫ I'm staring ♫ ♫ I Feel You (Was Like-Dream) ♫"
