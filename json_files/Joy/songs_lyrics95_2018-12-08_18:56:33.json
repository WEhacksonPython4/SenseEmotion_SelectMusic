  "lyrics": "今年もこうして二人で　クリスマスを祝ういろいろあった一年が　もうじき終るたとえば去年の今頃を　思い出してみる何も言わずに君が　小さく笑う窓の外に白く　聖なる夜に深く音もなく舞う雪が　つもりはじめる一番大切なものを　見失わないようにゆっくりとゆっくりと過ぎゆく時間を　ながめてるぼくのそばで白く　聖なる夜に深く少しつかれた君が　ねむりはじめる今年もこうして二人で　神様に祈るいつまでもいつまでも　一緒にいられますように",
  "translated_lyrics": "It's been like this year, and it's going to be like this year, and it's going to be a little bit of a little bit of the snow that's going to be the most important thing that you don't have to say to the last year. And it's going to be a little bit like this. You know, it's going to be a little bit like a little bit of fun, and it's a little bit like me, and it's a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more. And this is how you'll stop.　We can stay together.",
