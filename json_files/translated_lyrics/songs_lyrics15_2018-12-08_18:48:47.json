  "lyrics": "君と出会って　初めての冬街路樹も綺麗に　雪化粧をしてる今日はChristmas泣かせたことも　あったけれど今僕の心の　どこを切ってみても君しか　見えない好きさ　生まれて初めて　体の底から愛しいと思える人だからせめて　今夜はこのまま　そばにいてほしい外は降り止まぬ雪初めて君に贈るよMerry Christmas 心から To You夜空に泳ぐ　星座の群れが二人の未来(これから)を　やさしく照らしてる今こそ　誓うよいつでも　君を守り抜く　君の楯になる二度目の僕らのChristmasだから　今夜もこのまま　そばにいてほしいいくつもの Silent Night With You一途な君に贈るよMerry ChristmasずっとTo You好きさ　生まれて初めて　体の底から愛しいと思える人だからせめて　今夜はこのまま　そばにいてほしい外は降り止まぬ雪初めて君に贈るよMerry Christmas 心から To You",
  "translated_lyrics": "It's the first time I've ever seen you in winter, and I've always been able to see you in a beautiful snowflake, but you're the only person you can see from the bottom of my heart, and you're the first person to be able to see you, and you're not going to be there for the first time, and I'm going to send you to you tonight. Merry Christmas, you're going to be swamping to the To You Nights.　I swear to you, I swear to you at the moment, that you're always on your way to protect you from the moment you're at the end of the first day of your life. Merry Christmas, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you love it from the bottom of your body for the first time, and you're going to be there tonight, and you're going to send you to the first snowball. From Christmas to To You"
